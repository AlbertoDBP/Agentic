# Data Quality Engine — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Status:** Approved

---

## 1. Problem

The platform accepts incomplete market data silently. Critical fields are missing for specific
tickers while peers of the same asset class have them — a condition that must be treated as a
system failure, not a graceful degradation. Scoring runs on whatever data is available, producing
unreliable scores without warning. Users have no visibility into data freshness or completeness,
which erodes trust.

---

## 2. Goals

1. Define what fields are required per asset class and enforce completeness automatically.
2. Self-heal missing fields by re-fetching from FMP (primary) or MASSIVE/Polygon (fallback).
3. Gate scoring so it never runs on incomplete data — if critical gaps remain unresolved, scoring
   is blocked and an alert is fired.
4. Surface data freshness and completeness status to users (portfolio page) and admins (data
   quality page).
5. Support dynamic field requirements promoted from analyst `feature_gap_log` without code
   deploys.

---

## 3. Architecture

A new containerised service `agent-14-data-quality` sits downstream of the market-data-service.
It never fetches primary market data — it only validates what other services wrote and heals gaps.

```text
market-data-service ──writes──▶ market_data_cache
       │                               │
       │ POST /data-quality/scan/trigger (after refresh)
       ▼                               ▼
agent-14-data-quality ──scans──▶ data_quality_issues
       │                              │
       ├── FMP client (primary)       │
       └── MASSIVE client (fallback)  ▼
                  │           data_quality_gate
                  │ fills            │
                  ▼                  ▼
         market_data_cache    income-scoring-service
                              (checks gate before running)
```

**Scan trigger mechanism:** After a successful market refresh, market-data-service makes an HTTP
POST to `agent-14:POST /data-quality/scan/trigger`. agent-14 responds with `202 Accepted` and
runs the scan asynchronously.

**Schedules** — added to `src/scheduler-service/app/jobs.py` using APScheduler (the platform
scheduler; not Prefect). Prefect is used only by agent-02-newsletter-ingestion.

- Triggered by market-data-service after each successful refresh → completeness scan for all
  tracked symbols
- Every 15 minutes → retry loop for open issues (max 3 attempts per issue)
- Nightly (2:00 AM ET) → analyst feature promotion from `feature_gap_log`

New scheduler jobs call agent-14 via HTTP POST (same pattern as `job_market_data_refresh` in
`scheduler-service/app/jobs.py`).

### 3.1 Asset Class Resolution

`market_data_cache` has no `asset_class` column. The scanner resolves asset class by joining to
`platform_shared.securities` on `symbol`:

```sql
SELECT m.symbol, s.asset_type
FROM platform_shared.market_data_cache m
LEFT JOIN platform_shared.securities s ON s.symbol = m.symbol
WHERE m.is_tracked = TRUE
```

**Vocabulary mapping** between `securities.asset_type` and `field_requirements.asset_class`
(canonical values from `src/shared/asset_class_detector/taxonomy.py`):

| `securities.asset_type` | `field_requirements.asset_class` |
| --- | --- |
| `DIVIDEND_STOCK` | `CommonStock` |
| `ETF` | `ETF` |
| `COVERED_CALL_ETF` | `ETF` |
| `CEF` | `CEF` |
| `BDC` | `BDC` |
| `EQUITY_REIT` | `REIT` |
| `MORTGAGE_REIT` | `REIT` |
| `MLP` | `MLP` |
| `PREFERRED_STOCK` | `Preferred` |
| `BOND` | *(skip — bonds not in scope)* |
| `NULL` | *(skip — no requirements can be resolved)* |

> **Note:** The platform canonical asset type values come from the asset-classification-service
> (`taxonomy.py`). Short-form variants like `REIT` (use `EQUITY_REIT`/`MORTGAGE_REIT`) and
> `PREFERRED` (use `PREFERRED_STOCK`) do not appear in `securities.asset_type`. Plain `ETF` is
> the exception — market-data-service writes it directly for plain ETFs fetched via the ETF
> info endpoint, so both `ETF` and `COVERED_CALL_ETF` mappings are needed.

If a symbol has no entry in `securities` or `asset_type IS NULL`, it is skipped in the
completeness scan and logged at DEBUG level.

### 3.2 Portfolio-to-Symbol Join for Gate Evaluation

The quality gate operates at portfolio level. The scanner identifies which symbols belong to a
portfolio via:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.portfolio_id, p.symbol
FROM platform_shared.positions p
WHERE p.quantity > 0
```

A portfolio's gate is blocked if any of its active positions (`quantity > 0`) has a `critical`
severity issue. Positions with `quantity = 0` (closed positions) are excluded from gate
evaluation.

---

## 4. Database Tables

All tables in `platform_shared`.

### 4.1 `field_requirements`

Defines what fields are required per asset class. Populated from seed data and analyst
promotions.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | SERIAL PK | |
| `asset_class` | TEXT NOT NULL | `CommonStock \| ETF \| CEF \| BDC \| REIT \| MLP \| Preferred \| MORTGAGE_REIT` |
| `field_name` | TEXT NOT NULL | Column name in `market_data_cache` |
| `required` | BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE | FALSE = optional (warning only, never blocks gate) |
| `fetch_source_primary` | TEXT | `fmp \| massive \| null` (null = pending source mapping) |
| `fetch_source_fallback` | TEXT | `fmp \| massive \| null` |
| `source` | TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'core' | `core \| analyst_promoted` |
| `promoted_from_gap_id` | INTEGER | FK → `feature_gap_log.id` (analyst promotions only) |
| `source_endpoint` | TEXT | e.g. `fmp:/etf-info`, `massive:/v2/snapshot` |
| `description` | TEXT | Human-readable rationale |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW() | |

**Unique constraint:** `(asset_class, field_name)`

**Seed data — required fields per asset class:**

| Field | CommonStock | ETF | CEF | BDC | REIT | MORTGAGE_REIT | MLP | Preferred |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `price` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `week52_high` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `week52_low` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `dividend_yield` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `div_frequency` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `sma_50` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `sma_200` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `rsi_14d` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `payout_ratio` | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| `chowder_number` | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `consecutive_growth_yrs` | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `nav_value` | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| `nav_discount_pct` | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — |
| `interest_coverage_ratio` | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `debt_to_equity` | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |

**Notes on seed data:**

- **`nav_discount_pct` for ETF:** FMP `/etf-info` frequently returns null `nav_value` for plain
  ETFs and `COVERED_CALL_ETF` positions (see `market_cache.py:636`). When `nav_value` is null,
  `nav_discount_pct` cannot be computed. Set `required = FALSE` for `nav_discount_pct` on the
  `ETF` class in seed data. The scanner should treat missing `nav_discount_pct` as `warning`
  severity (never `critical`) and the healer should accept N/A after one failed attempt.

- **`promoted_from_gap_id` FK:** `feature_gap_log` is owned by `agent-02-newsletter-ingestion`.
  This FK is a cross-service reference. The agent-02 migration must run before the agent-14
  migration — enforce via `depends_on` ordering in `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Column names:** `interest_coverage_ratio` and `debt_to_equity` are the actual column names in
  `market_data_cache` (confirmed from `opportunity-scanner-service/app/scanner/market_cache.py`).
  The names `coverage_ratio` and `leverage_pct` do not exist.

**Fetch source priority:**

| Field(s) | Primary | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `price`, `week52_*`, `sma_*`, `rsi_14d` | MASSIVE | FMP |
| `dividend_yield`, `div_frequency`, `payout_ratio`, `chowder_number` | FMP `/dividends` | MASSIVE |
| `nav_value`, `nav_discount_pct` | FMP `/etf-info` | none |
| `interest_coverage_ratio`, `debt_to_equity` | FMP `/ratios` | MASSIVE financials |
| `consecutive_growth_yrs` | FMP `/dividends-history` | none |

---

### 4.2 `data_quality_issues`

Live tracker — one row per open or recently-resolved issue.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | SERIAL PK | |
| `symbol` | TEXT NOT NULL | Affected ticker |
| `field_name` | TEXT NOT NULL | Which field is missing |
| `asset_class` | TEXT NOT NULL | For peer comparison |
| `status` | TEXT NOT NULL | `missing \| fetching \| resolved \| unresolvable` |
| `severity` | TEXT NOT NULL | `warning \| critical` |
| `attempt_count` | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | Max 3 before → unresolvable |
| `last_attempted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | |
| `resolved_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Set on resolution |
| `source_used` | TEXT | `fmp \| massive` — which source resolved it |
| `diagnostic` | JSONB | See §5.2 |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW() | |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW() | |

**Severity rule:**

- `critical` — field is required AND at least one peer ticker of the same class has it populated
  → **blocks the quality gate**
- `warning` — field is required but no peer has it either → does not block gate

---

### 4.3 `data_quality_exemptions`

Per-symbol exemptions. Created when admin clicks "Mark N/A" for a specific ticker. Does **not**
change `field_requirements.required` — that would be a platform-wide change. Exemptions are
ticker-scoped only.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | SERIAL PK | |
| `symbol` | TEXT NOT NULL | Ticker being exempted |
| `field_name` | TEXT NOT NULL | Field being exempted |
| `asset_class` | TEXT NOT NULL | For context |
| `reason` | TEXT | Admin note (optional) |
| `created_by` | TEXT | Admin user ID |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW() | |

**Unique constraint:** `(symbol, field_name)`

When an exemption exists for a `(symbol, field_name)` pair, the scanner skips that combination
entirely — no issue is created and the pair does not contribute to gate blocking.

---

### 4.4 `data_quality_gate`

One row per portfolio per trading day. Controls whether scoring is allowed to run.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | SERIAL PK | |
| `portfolio_id` | UUID NOT NULL | FK → `portfolios.id` (UUID — matches existing schema) |
| `gate_date` | DATE NOT NULL | Trading day |
| `status` | TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' | `pending \| passed \| blocked` |
| `gate_passed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | When all critical issues resolved |
| `blocking_issue_count` | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | |
| `scoring_triggered_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | When scoring was fired after gate passed |
| `scoring_completed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | When scoring confirmed completion |

**Unique constraint:** `(portfolio_id, gate_date)`

---

### 4.5 `data_refresh_log`

One row per portfolio — upserted (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`) by market-data-service and
income-scoring-service after each successful run. Not an append log; always reflects latest state.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `portfolio_id` | UUID PK | FK → `portfolios.id` (UUID — matches existing schema) |
| `market_data_refreshed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Written by market-data-service |
| `scores_recalculated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Written by income-scoring-service |
| `market_staleness_hrs` | NUMERIC(6,2) | See formula below |
| `holdings_complete_count` | INTEGER | Holdings with zero open issues |
| `holdings_incomplete_count` | INTEGER | Holdings with ≥1 open issue |
| `critical_issues_count` | INTEGER | Issues where severity = `critical` |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW() | |

**`market_staleness_hrs` formula** (computed by agent-14 after each scan):

```sql
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - market_data_refreshed_at)) / 3600.0
```

**Staleness thresholds:**

| Condition | Status | UI colour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `staleness_hrs <= 24` | Fresh | Green |
| `24 < staleness_hrs <= 48` | Warning | Amber |
| `staleness_hrs > 48` | Stale | Red |
| `scores_recalculated_at` is >6h behind `market_data_refreshed_at` | Drift warning | Amber |

---

## 5. Self-Healing Engine

### 5.1 Issue Lifecycle

```text
MISSING → FETCHING → RESOLVED
                  ↘ FAILED → (retry in 15 min, max 3 total)
                           ↘ UNRESOLVABLE → ALERT
```

**Heal logic per attempt:**

1. Check `data_quality_exemptions` — if exemption exists, skip silently.
2. Try primary source (per `field_requirements.fetch_source_primary`).
3. If empty/error → try fallback source.
4. If both fail → increment `attempt_count`, schedule retry.
5. After 3 failed attempts → `status = unresolvable`, fire system alert.

**Peer comparison before UNRESOLVABLE:** Before escalating, the engine queries whether any peer
ticker of the same asset class has the field populated in `market_data_cache`. If yes →
`severity = critical`. If no → `severity = warning`. This is the distinction between a fetch
failure (system failure) and a data gap that doesn't exist anywhere yet.

### 5.2 Diagnostic Codes

Stored as JSONB in `data_quality_issues.diagnostic`:

| Code | Meaning | Suggested Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TICKER_NOT_FOUND` | Symbol absent from source entirely | Verify ticker; may be delisted or OTC |
| `FIELD_NOT_SUPPORTED` | Ticker found but source doesn't carry this field | Try fallback; if both fail, accept N/A |
| `CLASSIFICATION_MISMATCH` | Source asset type differs from our `asset_class` | Re-run asset classification |
| `PEER_DIVERGENCE` | Value resolves but is >3σ from peer average | Flag for human review |
| `STALE_DATA` | `fetched_at` is older than 48h threshold | Source may be throttling |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | API responded 429 | Auto-retry with backoff; escalate if recurring |
| `AUTH_ERROR` | API key rejected | System-level alert; blocks all fetches from source |
| `ZERO_VALUE` | Field returned 0 — ambiguous with missing | Compare to peers |

**Example diagnostic payload:**

```json
{
  "code": "CLASSIFICATION_MISMATCH",
  "detail": "FMP classifies MAIN as 'CommonStock'; registry expects BDC fields",
  "fmp_response_asset_type": "CommonStock",
  "peer_sample": ["ARCC", "ORCC", "GBDC"],
  "peers_have_field": true,
  "suggested_action": "re_classify"
}
```

## 6. Quality Gate

### 6.1 Gate Logic

After each scan cycle, agent-14 evaluates the gate for each portfolio:

- Resolve active positions: `SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM positions WHERE portfolio_id = X AND quantity > 0`
- Count open `critical` issues for those symbols (excluding exempted pairs)
- If `critical_issues_count == 0` → `gate_status = passed`, record `gate_passed_at`
- If `critical_issues_count > 0` → `gate_status = blocked`

### 6.2 Scoring Service Integration

Before running, income-scoring-service calls:

```text
GET /data-quality/gate/{portfolio_id}
→ { "status": "passed" | "blocked", "blocking_issue_count": N, "gate_passed_at": "..." }
```

- `status == passed` → proceed with scoring, write `scoring_triggered_at`
- `status != passed` → log at WARNING level, exit cleanly — no scores produced

### 6.3 End-of-Day Timeline

| Time (ET) | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 4:00 PM | Market close |
| ~4:30 PM | market-data-service refresh completes; writes `market_data_refreshed_at` |
| ~4:31 PM | agent-14 scan triggered via HTTP POST; issues detected and written |
| ~4:31–5:30 PM | Self-healing retries (15-min intervals, up to 3 attempts) |
| ~5:30 PM | Gate evaluated: passed or blocked |
| ~5:30–10:00 PM | income-scoring-service runs if gate passed (target: <6h after close) |

**Drift warning:** If `scores_recalculated_at` is >6h behind `market_data_refreshed_at`, a drift
warning is raised even if the gate eventually passed.

---

## 7. Analyst Feature Promotion

Nightly job (2:00 AM ET) queries `feature_gap_log`:

```sql
SELECT metric_name_raw, asset_class, occurrence_count
FROM platform_shared.feature_gap_log
WHERE occurrence_count >= 2
  AND resolution_status = 'pending'
  AND asset_class IS NOT NULL
```

`occurrence_count` is the existing column on `feature_gap_log` that tracks how many times a
metric has been cited across articles. Threshold `>= 2` means the metric appeared in at least
two articles (de-duplicated by the unique constraint on `(metric_name_raw, asset_class)`).

For each qualifying row that is not already in `field_requirements`:

- INSERT with `source = 'analyst_promoted'`, `required = FALSE` (warning-only until manually
  promoted), `fetch_source_primary = NULL` (status: `pending_source_mapping`)

Admin reviews promoted fields in the data quality page:

- Assign `fetch_source_primary` → field becomes active in next scan cycle
- Mark as N/A → `required = FALSE` permanently, no further promotion attempts

No code deploy required — the scanner reads the registry live.

---

## 8. API Endpoints (agent-14)

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/data-quality/scan/trigger` | Trigger scan (called by market-data-service) |
| `GET` | `/data-quality/gate/{portfolio_id}` | Gate status for scoring service |
| `GET` | `/data-quality/issues` | All open issues (filterable by symbol, class, severity) |
| `GET` | `/data-quality/issues/{symbol}` | Issues for a specific ticker |
| `GET` | `/data-quality/refresh-log/{portfolio_id}` | Freshness timestamps |
| `POST` | `/data-quality/issues/{id}/retry` | Manual retry trigger |
| `POST` | `/data-quality/issues/{id}/mark-na` | Create per-symbol exemption (does NOT change `field_requirements`) |
| `POST` | `/data-quality/issues/{id}/reclassify` | Trigger asset re-classification for symbol |
| `GET` | `/data-quality/field-requirements` | Full registry (read) |
| `PATCH` | `/data-quality/field-requirements/{id}` | Update source mapping (admin only) |

**`mark-na` behaviour:** Creates a row in `data_quality_exemptions` for the specific
`(symbol, field_name)` pair. Closes the current issue. Does not modify `field_requirements` — the
field remains required for all other tickers of the same asset class.

## 9. Frontend Changes

### 9.1 Portfolio Page — Health Card

Expandable card below the portfolio name/value header. Collapsed by default.

**Collapsed (healthy):**

```text
● Data Health: All Good   Market 4:32 PM · Scores 6:14 PM   ▾
```

**Collapsed (blocked):**

```text
● Data Health: Scoring Blocked   2 critical gaps · ARCC, MAIN   Expand ▾
```

**Expanded:**

- Market refresh timestamp + staleness status
- Score recalc timestamp + gate status
- Complete holdings count / total
- Critical issues count with ticker list
- Link → Data Quality Dashboard

### 9.2 Holdings Table — Completeness Badges

New `Data` column in the holdings table:

- `✓ Complete` — green — no open issues
- `✕ N critical` — red — N critical issues (clicking opens admin page filtered to that ticker)
- `⚠ N warning` — amber — N warning-only issues

Badges use a tooltip showing the specific missing field names on hover. Color is always paired
with an icon/text label (never color alone) for accessibility.

### 9.3 Data Quality Admin Page (`/admin/data-quality`)

**KPI row (4 cards):** Gate status · Market refresh time · Last scores time · Holdings complete
count

**Issues table columns:** Ticker · Class · Missing Field · Severity · Attempts · Diagnostic code
(tooltip with full JSON) · Actions (Retry Now / Re-classify / Mark N/A)

**Resolved section:** Last 24h resolutions with source and timestamp.

**Filter bar:** By asset class · By severity · By status

---

## 10. Design Constraints

### 10.1 Contrast & Readability

All new UI components must meet WCAG AA minimums:

- 4.5:1 contrast ratio for body text
- 3:1 for large/bold text and UI components

This standard applies platform-wide. Many existing `text-muted-foreground` instances on dark
backgrounds fall below 3:1 and should be corrected incrementally. A dedicated accessibility
standard document should be created and referenced by all future feature specs.

Status indicators must pair color with icon or text — never rely on color alone.

---

## 11. Component Map

---

## 12. Key Constraints

- **No new primary data fetching** — agent-14 only heals gaps; market-data-service remains the
  primary fetcher.
- **Single gate check** — scoring service calls one endpoint; no polling.
- **MASSIVE key** — `MASSIVE_KEY` env var already present in `.env`; add to agent-14 container
  environment in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Field registry is live** — scanner reads `field_requirements` on every cycle; no service
  restart required to add or promote fields.
- **Scoring must not self-start** — scoring only runs after explicit gate pass confirmation; never
  on a fixed clock independent of the gate.
- **Warning-only issues never block** — gate only blocks on `critical` severity.
- **mark-na is per-symbol** — exemptions are scoped to a single ticker; `field_requirements`
  is never modified by a mark-na action.
